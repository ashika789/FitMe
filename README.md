# FitMe
2015 HackGT - Intelligent Personalized Fitness Routines

## Summary
FitMe is the app that does it all for you when it comes to working out. Whether you are in shape or not, several people struggle to find a workout online that pertains to their body type and preferences. Thus, with FitMe, we help you solve this problem.<br />

## User Interface & Demo
The UI of this application is very user friendly, appealing to the eye, and all custom and made by the UI Designer of the team. This will make using this app accessible and useful to people of all age!

## Tools
We built this application using the Android Studio IDE. For the payment and transaction process between the customer and the trainer, we used Capital One's Nessie Client for authentication and verification. Our original logo was created using Photoshop CS5.

## Usage and Purpose
The customer opens the app and is able to make a new user account.<br />
Once they make a new account, they are prompted to enter in their name, age, height, and weight. Using this and the standard mathematical formula for BMI, we are able to tell them their body mass index.<br /><br />

However, this BMI result is not an accurate representation of a person. For example, you may be very muscular, thus weighing a lot, and according to the BMI model you would be overweight or obese, but in actuality, you are healthy and fit! To overcome this inaccuracy, we prompt the customer with a few survey questions where we are able to assess how fit they are, what their target goals are, and how much time they would have for this. Based on these results, we are able to connect the user with a set of specified personal trainers in their local area that the customer might be interested in.<br /><br />

If they like any of them, they may click their image and continue on to a payment screen to purchase their workout plan. Due to the lack of time, we were not able to implement our very last feature which would have been automatically creating a schedule per week and having workouts displayed. For example, if they had chosen they want to improve their arms on the survey, and they are not fit, we would assign a day of the week to Arms with workouts at a novice and intermediate level along with a lot of cardio If they had chosen to work on their chest and are very active, we would be able to assign them a day of the week and their workout routine would consist of intermediate to advanced workouts (such as workout machines). Once they receive their workout, the customer will be allowed to reject, with a reason up for why they don't want to do the specific workout, to a certain number of workouts, which would then notify the trainer and they would send in a new workout.<br /><br />
